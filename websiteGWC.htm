	About Me
	
	
</h1>

<p>My name is Madison Cerpa. I have lived in many places and been fortunate to explore the world. 
This year I have lived in Nicaragua where there are beaches <b> everywhere </b>. </p>

<h2>LIKES</h2> 
<p> I love to eat cheescake and sushi as well as create art. I'm a little odd and love to learn 
about science.</p> 

<h2>DISLIKES</h2> 
<p>I despise history because it's tooo much to remember and people that walk too slow. </p>

<h2>FUN FACT</h2> 
<p> Hmm...I'm starting a dog shetler in Nicaragua.</p>
